# CHESS IN JS

Chess with JavaScript, minimax algorithm and Chess.com API; Minimax examines a tree of possible moves based on your level (easy, medium, hard). Because it uses recursion, it becomes slow at times. A statistics page was implemented with the chess.com API in JSON format using XMLHttpRequests. You can upload photos to use in your player profile. This project was based on other creations for the CS50 final project offered by HarvardX.
